**Attending Dentist:** Dr. Emily Thompson  
**Location:** Greenfield Dental Clinic, 123 Oak Street, Springfield, IL  

**Reason for Visit:**  
Mr. Harvey D’Amore presents for a routine check-up and management of gingivitis.

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient reports experiencing swollen and tender gums over the past few weeks, with occasional bleeding during brushing and persistent bad breath.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. D’Amore is a 59-year-old male who has been experiencing gingival tenderness and bleeding upon brushing for approximately three weeks. He reports that bleeding is most notable when flossing and notes some persistent bad breath, which has not improved with regular oral hygiene measures. Mr. D’Amore admits to occasionally skipping his night-time oral hygiene routine. He denies any recent changes in his diet or medication. The patient has no history of significant dental issues prior to this episode and last had a dental check-up approximately six months ago.

**Dental Procedures Performed:**  
1. **Dental Consultation and Report:** Comprehensive evaluation of Mr. D’Amore's oral health status was conducted. Signs consistent with mild to moderate gingivitis were observed.
   
2. **Dental Care Regime/Therapy Initiation:** Establishing a more rigorous oral hygiene routine including twice-daily brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush and daily flossing was recommended. Emphasis on technique was provided.

3. **Removal of Supragingival Plaque and Calculus:** Complete scaling of all teeth was performed to remove plaque and calculus deposits above the gum line.

4. **Removal of Subgingival Plaque and Calculus:** Thorough scaling of all teeth to remove plaque and calculus below the gum line was undertaken to reduce periodontal pockets.

5. **Examination of Gingivae:** Comprehensive examination revealed inflammation and slight edema of gingival tissues consistent with gingivitis. No abscesses or serious periodontal issues were noted.

6. **Oral Health Education:** Mr. D’Amore received instruction on effective brushing and flossing techniques, the importance of consistent oral hygiene, and dietary recommendations to support gum health. The patient was advised to consider using an antiseptic mouthwash to help control plaque.

**Assessment:**  
_
1. Gingivitis: Mild to moderate gingival inflammation with associated bleeding and halitosis.

**Plan:**  
1. Reinforce oral hygiene education and stress compliance with recommended measures.
2. Schedule follow-up appointment in 3 months for reassessment and maintenance cleaning.
3. Consider follow-up with periodontist if symptoms do not improve.

**Comments:**  
Patient was advised that, with adherence to proper oral hygiene practices, symptoms of gingivitis are expected to resolve, and risk for progression to periodontitis can be minimized.
